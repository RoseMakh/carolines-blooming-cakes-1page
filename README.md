# carolines-blooming-cakes-1page
(Portfolio Piece) A one-page, responsive website, designed and built by me. Designed "mobile-first".

This is a demo site for my web developer portfolio, for a fictional cusom wedding cake company called Caroline's Blooming Cakes.
The images are from Pixabay. The ipsum is from Cupcake Ipsum.

The site uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I designed this with mobile in mind first. I'll eventually add media queries for responsiveness on larger screens.

This page was designed so that each section fills the viewport. Like pages in a book or slides in a slideshow, each individual section fills the entire window and commands the user's attention.
